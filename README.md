# Head First Learn to Code exercises

This repo contains the exercises I complete from _Head First Learn to Code_, which uses Python to teach the fundamentals of programming.

## Chapter 1

### rock.py

Learned to output/print a string to screen in Python.

### Phrase-O-Matic

Learned to import random functionality; create lists of strings; create variables and assign them random values from lists; create a variable which concatenates those values into a phrase; then print the resulting phrase.

It's marketing, baby!

## Chapter 2

### Dog Age Calculator

Learned to solicit user input with a prompt and store that input as a variable; convert that stored input from a string to an integer; write an expression to perform a calculation; convert an integer back to a string; pass multiple arguments into the `print` function (interpolate rather than concatenate) to output to the user, using the stored input.

## Chapter 3

### Shoushiling

A rock-paper-scissors game. Learned to generate a random integer; add decisions/ conditional statements with relational operators; use Boolean operators; and add loops. Learned to handle invalid input by testing validity then looping back to input request if invalid.

Learned some basic game design logic: handling ties, determining who won by testing the conditions for the computer's victory, then coding if the computer doesn't win, the player wins, without testing specific winning conditions for the player. Leaner, but potentially more error-prone approach.

### Color Guessing Game

More practice using the `while` loop, `if` and `else`, and `random.choice`.
