# Head First Learn to Code exercises

This repo contains the exercises I complete from *Head First Learn to Code*, which uses Python to teach the fundamentals of programming.

## Chapter 1

### rock.py

Learned to output/print a string to screen in Python.

### Phrase-O-Matic

Learned to import random functionality; create lists of strings; create variables and assign them random values from lists; create a variable which concatinates those values into a phrase; then print the resulting phrase.

It's marketing, baby!
