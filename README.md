# Head First Learn to Code exercises

This repo contains the exercises I complete from _Head First Learn to Code_, which uses Python to teach the fundamentals of programming.

## Chapter 1

### rock.py

Learned to output/print a string to screen in Python.

### Phrase-O-Matic

Learned to import random functionality; create lists of strings; create variables and assign them random values from lists; create a variable which concatinates those values into a phrase; then print the resulting phrase.

It's marketing, baby!

## Chapter 2

### Dog Age Calculator

Learned to solicit user input with a prompt and store that input as a variable; convert that stored input from a string to an integer; write an expression to perform a calculation; convert an integer back to a string; pass multiple arguments into the `print` function (rather than concatenate) to output to the user, using the stored input.
